## Generating Images from Captions with Attention

### Work in progress ...

I haven't yet committed the relevant files to reproduce Microsoft COCO experiments, but you can reproduce MNIST with captions experiments.

Depending on the task, you would need to download the following dataset files. These can be obtained by running:

```
wget http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~emansim/datasets/mnist.h5
```
